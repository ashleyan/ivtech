                      <p>“[The body's] parts are many, but they all form one body.
                        So it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,

                        We're a fellowship that lives life together.
                        InterVarsity isn't just another club to be in—it's also where
                        we've met some of the greatest people and ate, studied, and stayed up late with them.
                        Join us as we get to know, support, and encourage one another through the ups and downs of life at Columbia.</p>

                        For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress."<br><br>

                        Worship is one of the ways we testify, whether on Thursday evening Ignites or in informal, spontaneous prayer meetings.
                        You'll never have to attend church alone:
                        We're plugged in to Christ-centered ministries across the city,
                        and we'd be glad to help find the right church for you.</p>

                        InterVarsity takes you places.
                        We're a fellowship that spontaneously decides to bus into Washington DC for a weekend revival event.
                        From events like our fall retreat in the Poconos mountains to Basileia by the waters of Lake Saranac,
                        you'll have a faith family to hit the road with while seeking Christ. </p>

                                  Each week, InterVarsity comes together to take part in music and hear the week's message.
                                  Ignite is where real community-building happens, and it wouldn't be complete without you.</p>

                                <p><u>Exploring what it means to be Latinx through the lens of Christ</u><br>
                                  Latinidad's fusion of rich African, European, and indigenous cultures can bring
                                  about the feeling of "ni de aqui ni de alla," not of here or there. We hope that La Fe
                                  will be a place where Latinx students can meet and feel comfortable discussing the tensions
                                  and joys that come along with our ethnic identities and our walk with God.

                                <p><u>More Than Just a Bible Study Group</u><br>
                                  Life Groups are small groups of students who wish to better understand who God is and live life together.
                                  Life Groups learn about God through reading and discussing the Bible together,
                                  but also come together to study, play sports, cook, and much more.

													We're a community of friends-turned-family. We hang out with each other, study with one another,

													support system that will help make your college experience the joyous, fruitful experience it ought to be. We're an outlet

                                  Hey everyone, my name is Shawn. I am a senior studying Chemistry and Earth Science at Columbia College and I am the current InterVarsity Chapter President. Though born and raised in China, I've spent most of my life in rural Alabama. When I'm not busy analyzing sediment cores from the seafloor or organizing events for InterVarsity, you can find me playing squash at Dodge or drinking bubble tea from Cafe East.</p>

                                  Hi! I’m Hannah, a junior studying English and Human Rights. I love soup, petting strangers’ dogs, and oxford commas. Born and raised in Los Angeles, I have fallen in love with New York and have gained an appreciation for never having to find parking. On campus, I am an associate copy editor for the Columbia Spectator and when I’m not waiting in line at the Korean food truck on Broadway or boxing, you can find me watching Queen of Katwe or Mad Max: Fury Road.</p>

                                <h4><strong>Outreach Coordinator: Jonathan Zhang</strong></h4>
                                <p>
                                  I was born and raised far from the lights and snow of NYC in sunny California and, by the grace of God, saved as a high schooler. At Intervarsity this year, I am excited to serve as the Outreach leader to encourage each other in the fellowship to boldly share the gospel of Christ. I study Computer Science and Economics (fulfilling several NorCal stereotypes) as a sophomore in Columbia College. I still don’t quite understand how New Yorkers survive the winters here and why Chicken over Rice tastes like heaven at 2am. My goal this year is to figure out how to sneak an air conditioner into Wien without losing guaranteed housing.</p>

                                  Hey! I'm Christina, a junior majoring in American Studies with a concentration in Media & Pop Culture, and minoring in Political Science—i.e., a mixture of history, politics, and media. When not relentlessly sending friends the latest inspirational how-to article, I can be found at Notes & Keys (a cappella) rehearsal, pretending to be a vlogger, or Pinteresting (hip, I know). If you're somehow connected to Oprah, Casey Neistat, Solange, or Tracee Ellis Ross, let's be friends.</p>

                                  Hi, I'm Hannah and I am a junior at Barnard studying Anthropology. I was born and raised in Southern California, but moved to Japan when I was 13 and have since loved to travel the world. My experiences abroad have really shaped my dreams of going into missional medicine and healthcare policy. Some of my favorite things include dogspotting, biking down the Hudson, being a foodie, and Christmastime!</p>

I'm originally from Houston, TX but NYC has become my home, and InterVarsity has become my family. When I'm not planning events to bring the fellowship together, I'm probably reading a Victorian novel in a coffee shop, strolling through Central Park, or stalking cute dogs on Instagram.</p><br>

                                <p>
                                  Hello!! I'm Amber, a senior studying political science and sociology at Barnard College. As Social Justice Team Coordinator I love working with my community to make sure all people can experience the love of God. Whenever I'm not working I can be found in a park, watching "The Office" or searching for NYC's best red velvet cake.</p><br>

                                <h4><strong>Mentorship Coordinator: Kristen Song</strong></h4>
                                <p>
                                  Hello hello! My name is Kristen. I am a junior majoring in Chemistry at Barnard College who was born into a military family, raised in 3 different countries, moved a total of 10 times (so far), and hopes to keep counting for the rest of my life. Currently, home is Kansas, but New York is growing on me fast. I love to travel, especially to see natural landmarks to witness my Maker's boundless creativity, but also to encounter diverse testimonies, foods, and cultures. During my leisure time, I love to watch the sunset, take walks in Riverside Park, and have spontaneous one-on-one bubble tea dates with friends~</p>

                                <p>
                                  Hi! My name is Julissa. I'm a first generation, Dominican-American (soon to be) civil engineer from the Bronx. I'm a senior and this year's Prayer Coordinator. I found Intervarsity my sophomore year through my super cool roommate, and my college experience has been getting better ever since. As a native New Yorker, I walk really fast and get annoyed by slow walking tourists. I've recently taken up doing a lot more touristy things, so I have become the villain in my own story.</p>

                                <h4><strong>Staff Leader: Alex Lee</strong></h4>
                                <p>
                                  Hello, I'm Alex! I graduated from Columbia in 2017 as a Biochemistry major and I am InterVarsity's Staff Leader for this school year. I became a Christian as a first-year in college and still can't believe that the Lord would call me to full-time ministry, but I'm so excited to serve the students and faculty at Columbia. When I'm not ranting about how cool proteins and molecules are (they're really awesome), I'm probably either watching anime and reading manga, bouldering, or thinking about life. My goal in life is to one day own a Samoyed dog.</p>
